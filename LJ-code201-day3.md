# LJ Code 201- Day 3

Today was killer. Something as simple as for and while loops ate away the afternoon and early evening.  
The most time consuming periods were when I was trying to understand how information was passing through  
loops. What I explained verbally wasn't happening literally.

Somehow at the end of the day I was able to recoil from the panic of the last question - count all the correct answers to  
print them - and use a simple approach to quickly finish it. In the conditional after every correct answer, I used a tally  
variable to keep count and printed it after the questions were finished. Ended on a good note.

##Notes about truthy and falsey values
I had problems visualizing how nested loops interact with the data.
null and undefined are falsey values
null is an object for some reason
undefined is undefined
the difference between the two is intention
undefined is the default
if something is null it was made that way

##Tips on debugging
log what the variable is  
log what the type of the variable is  
One helpful example was when I logged 'out of the loop' when I got out of a (complex for now) loop.
