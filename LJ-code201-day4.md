# Learning Journal 201 day 4

I need to continue to improve my algorithm before I start coding. It appears my brain is describing multiple actions that needs to be separated in my code. For example, if want to give a user 6 opportunities to guess an element in my array, I need code to operate on the opportunities, separate code to loop and compare the guess to my array, extra code to remember if a match was made, and separate code to evaluate the match.  

So far on functions I feel comfortable, understanding the structure, some of the scope pertaining to variables, and how to call them.

More practice needs to be done on git pull requests and forking. It's hard to conceptualize a pull request when it seems like the action was a push on the local. The vocabulary makes it confusing.  

Layout position will continue to be a work in progress to understand how relative, fixed, and float interact with each other on the page.

## Notes:  

break statements are better suited in if/else statements and rarely in loops  

function template:  
function functionName() {  
  console.log('function stuff here');  
}
<!-- call the function -->
functionName();
