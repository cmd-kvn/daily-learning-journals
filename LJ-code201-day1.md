# LJ Code 201 - Day 1

##"Failing to prepare is preparing to fail."  
Shout out to John Wooden for the quote and shout out to the prework, code 101, code 102, and my CS instructors at Clackamas Community College for all the preparation leading up to today. Some of the material today was redundant but it was welcomed by me. Like Aaron believes, going through the concepts/lesson 3x is a solid way to cement \*pun\* them mentally. I especially need a stronger foundation in the git workflow to improve my comfort using its tools.

ACP: add, commit, push  
Add: git add fileName to stage the file .  
Commit: git commit -m "description" to save the current state of the file for version control.  
Push: git push <remote> <branch> to push the commit to github.

One accomplishment today that I'm proud of is the mad amount of comments I added in my assignment. It may have been a small, short exercise but if I can instill this habit of explicitly explaining myself as I code I believe it will make me a more productive developer.
