# LJ Code 201 - Day 2

Things that were challenging today: conceptualizing pull requests and CSS layout.

Thing that was entertaining: continuing to weave themes from Rush Hour into my projects.

To my understanding, here's how a pull request works:
1. Checkout to a branch on git  
2. Do your code locally  
3. ACP to the branch  
4. The push to the branch creates a PR (pull request)  
5. After merging, now the branch and the master are up to date  
6. Checkout back to the master on git  
7. Pull the updated code from the master on to your local master  
8. Now we're jiving
