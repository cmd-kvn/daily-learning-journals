split turns a string into an array. variableString.split('identifier') will target the identifier in the string, split the string into two, and store it as an array.
## Review

#### CSS notes
- 'clear' is applied to everything left after it, restores flow of the DOM
- 'outline' won't mess with size like border does but still draws a 'border'
- 'display: inline-block;' good for ul's, navs
- __DON'T__ use 'position' for layout, use DISPLAY
- clearing floats: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/GNMqae?editors=1100
